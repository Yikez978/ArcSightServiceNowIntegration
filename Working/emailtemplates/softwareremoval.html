Hello, <br/><br/>

By way of introduction, my name is Steven and I am member of [Company]'s Detection Analysis and Response Team.  Our role is to detect computer viruses, malware, unapproved software posing risk, and other malicious activity on the [Company] network.<br/><br/>

Our team has identified that your system has downloaded unapproved software (please see the link to [Company] policy below).  The software will need to be removed and a malware scan of your system is required.<br/><br/>

Please help us protect your information and the [Company] network by working with the desktop team to have your machine scanned in the timeliest manner possible.  Prolonging the scan places your personal information, customer data and [Company] proprietary data at risk. A ticket has been created on your behalf and routed to the Enterprise Service Desk to coordinate the removal of unapproved software and a malware scan of your system.   Unfortunately, if prompt action is not taken, your system may be disconnected from the network.   Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.<br/><br/>

Please let me know if you have any questions.<br/><br/>
