Hello, <br/><br/>

By way of introduction, my name is Steven and I am member of [Company]'s Detection Analysis and Response Team.  Our role is to detect computer viruses, malware and other malicious activity on the [Company] network.<br/><br/>

Our team has identified malware on your system. A re-image of your system is required to rid the malware from your machine.<br/><br/>

A Help Desk ticket (listed above) has been created and routed to Field Support to coordinate your system re-image.  Please note, it is important for the reimage to take place in the timeliest manner possible. Prolonging the reimage places both your personal information and corporate data at risk.  Command-and-control botnet membership, credential theft, and fraud are the risks most commonly associated with malware. <br/><br/>

If no action is taken, your system may be disconnected from the network. Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.<br/><br/>

Please let me know if you have any questions.<br/><br/>
