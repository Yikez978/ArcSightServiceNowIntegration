Hello, <br/><br/>

By way of introduction, my name is Steven and I am member of [Company]'s Detection Analysis and Response Team.  Our role is to detect computer viruses, malware, and other malicious activity on the [Company] network. <br/><br/>

Our team has identified your system as having connected to a site hosting malicious code that could have compromised your asset.  Due to the severity of this and that your system has connected to a potentially malicious site, a malware scan of your system is the ideal solution to this issue. <br/><br/>

To assist this process I have created the above ticket and routed to Enterprise Service Desk to coordinate with you for the scan of your system at your earliest availability.  It is important for the scan to take place in the timeliest manner possible.  Prolonging the scan places both your personal information and corporate data at risk.  If no action is taken, your system may be disconnected from the network.   Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter. <br/><br/>

Please let me know if you have any questions. <br/><br/>
